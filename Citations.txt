The code in cross validation iPython notebooks is not originally written by me. 
I am citing the source from which I included the code (http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/)
to learn and apply the Zoo Data on the RandomForestClassifier model

For adding comments on each of the classifier methods, I have borrowed verbiage from the scikit-learn documentation - http://scikit-learn.org/
